# Framed Icon Generator [![Gitpod Ready-to-Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-ready--to--code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/zentala/framed-icon-generator)

## üåç Overview
Adds rounded border and description around icon. 

I use it to generate labels for my collection of electronic components.

# üìù Limitations in Icon Provision
Unfortunately, I am unable to provide the specific icons I used due to copyright issues. While I can offer the entire code for generating the frames, the icons themselves, essential for a complete product, are missing. If you have ideas for circumventing this, such as creating your own icon set or using open-source electronics icons sets, please feel free to submit your PRs and implement changes. Despite the lack of icons, I still hope to inspire someone in creating something similar.

# üí° SaaS Business Idea
I often lack the time to realize my business ideas, but there is a substantial business potential in custom sticker generation and developing a SaaS platform to handle user orders and printing. Possible sticker types include:
1) Transparent company logos for equipment marking.
2) Contact information stickers for documents and personal items, aiding in recovery during travels.
3) Electronic icons, similar to what I've created.
4) Icons for smart home buttons, clarifying their functions.
5) Labels for jars and storage containers.

This service seems absent in the market, especially in Poland, and I would be a potential customer. If you're interested in investing in such a venture, contact [Zentala Innovation Agency](http://zentala.agency/), that I created to realize such innovative projects.

# üñ®Ô∏è Print Quality
I used a Brother PT-E550W printer at 180dpi, resulting in legible but slightly pixelated prints. For professional applications, I recommend a 360dpi printer, like the PT-P950, for clearer output.

## üèó Development & demo
Click `Gitpod` button above to setup development workspace in the Cloud and develop code in your browser. [You can read more about GitPod on the officail website of the project.](https://www.gitpod.io/)

### Usage

``` bash
$ node index --title "relay" --output "relay"
Added title "RELAY" to the icon
Icon saved as relay.png
$
```

You can shorten it to:
``` bash
$ node index -t "relay" -o "relay"
```

OR convert icons in batch:
``` bash
$ node index -b
```

All icons from `icons/input/` will be processed and saved into `icons/output/`.
